            All code for this assignment will be completed in a separate 
            file. You will not need to make any changes to the HTML file, 
            nor should this file be included in your submission. Please 
            create a separate file called controls-2.js for your code and 
            place it in the same folder as this file. Place your name in
            a comment at the top of the JavaScript file to be sure there 
            is no confusion with grading. Happy coding!
